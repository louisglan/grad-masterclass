Today you will be covering CSS. You *may* have noticed that HTML is a little bland on its own. CSS is used to style HTML i.e., make it pretty. CSS can be very powerful in the right hands - [this pokemon page](https://poke-holo.simey.me/) was styled entirely with CSS

Your activities will be:
Morning (11am-12pm):
1. Visit https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/ to find the course. Notes can be found at https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/html/tags
2. Watch the videos from "CSS Overview & Rules" up to and including "Pseudo-classes"

Afternoon (1pm-5pm):
1. Continue watching the videos up to and including "CSS Project"
2. Create a GitHub repository called "CSS coffee app"
3. Clone the repo and make a start on the project in the repo, committing regularly
4. In the last 30-45 mins of the day (or when you finished the project - whichever comes first) watch the CSS solution and Q&A videos
5. Stretch goals
    a. Animate the coffee logo however you like (e.g., make it spin)
    b. Give the button a different format when you hover your mouse over it and another format when you click on it
    c. Go into developer tools (right click > inspect in Chrome) and see how your phone looks on an iphone screen (select the laptop icon in the top left of dev tools). Does this look how you want it to? Try and use the docs to see how to fix this

If you finish all this in good time review [what to do if you get ahead](../Intro/tips.md)
