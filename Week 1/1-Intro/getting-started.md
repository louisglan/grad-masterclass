## What To Expect

### What You Will Learn

- You will be learning dev fundamentals. This course is intended to give you the coding skills required to land you in a technical role. This will likely be in a SFIA3 role, meaning you are expected to need support in this role. The focus will be on frontend development
- What is software development?
- Technology stack you will learn:
    - Frontend â€“ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Accessibility
    - Backend - Express
    - Databases - SQL
    - Cloud â€“ AWS

### What The Training Will Look Like

- The first part of the training period will last five weeks, culminating in a project. It will be followed by a three-week course on React and shadowing on a technical project. The start date of the React course is yet to be confirmed
- This course will be intensive - you will be training 9-5, 4 days a week and will be expected to use the fifth day to keep learning (if you have the day free). That said, you will be rewarded with the effort you put in. Coding can be extremely engaging and rewarding
- There is a set list of learnings/exercises for each day
- There is a lot to learn in a short space of time but you will get it if you throw yourself in
- This will be mostly remote - we wonâ€™t make you go into the office together more than once a week. That said please do work together in person if you prefer and feel free to book rooms for yourselves/arrange to come in to the office together
- A lot of the learning is video content - make sure you have headphones if you are working in the office

### Some Reassurances

- There are a lot of exercises to go through - it is good if you can complete them but donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t manage to. You will learn concepts better during project stages
- You will have support from each other and a group of experienced devs
- Things might come up that you havenâ€™t been explicitly taught. This will be rare but if it happens donâ€™t be afraid to look it up or ask what it is!
- You will have access to the paid tier of Frontend Masters for two months (starting two weeks in) so there will be time to recap videos if you wish after the training finishes

### A Couple of Asks

- Let me know if you have leave planned over the next 5 weeks
- Let me know if you have any accessibility needs I should be aware of
