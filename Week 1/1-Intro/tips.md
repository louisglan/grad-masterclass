## You Will Get Stuck

What do you do when you get stuck? As important as it is to follow the process below, the most important thing to remember is don't be afraid to ask for help... from anyone. Noone is expecting you to be an expert in the things you have just learnt. Teaching is a great way to learn so ask your peers for help they will get something out of it too! Now on to the process:

1. Nearly all code is deterministic - if you run it again with the same inputs you will get the same outputs. Simply rerunning your code without changing anything and hoping it works will almost exclusively fail you
2. Try and debug e.g., using `console.log` or a debugger
3. Use the internet - google, documentation, Stack Overflow and eyq are your friends. Try and use the documentation where possible. We all use the internet all the time it is part of our jobs not cheating! Web Dev Simplified is also a great YouTube channel for explaining concepts well
4. If you are still stuck after half an hour, ask the group chat for help. When asking for help from others, it may seem obvious but just saying ‚Äúmy code is broken‚Äù makes it very hard to help you fix it. In order to work around this, provide as much detail as you can:
    1. What is broken?
    2. What did you do to try to fix it? And what happened when you did each of these things?
    3. Provide any code/logs/screenshots etc. that may be helpful
    4. This may seem like a lot of effort for one issue but you will likely need to share all this information anyway and so providing it up front saves you the back and forth
5. If you get nowhere with the previous step you can ping the DE Dev Community Tech Support channel. We have some volunteers who you can @ with the ‚ÄúTraining Course Tech Support‚Äù tag

## Good Coding Practices

- ABC - Always Be Coding. Practice is key! If you have time, work on your own projects (start later in the course when you have the fundamentals down).
- DRY - Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself. This concept will make more sense when we get onto functions. In essence it means if you‚Äôve written the same code in multiple places, you may be able to extract it into a function that you can reuse
- Think carefully about your variable names - you want to be able to come back to your code and understand what it does. Naming variables well will help you do that. In an ideal world you shouldn‚Äôt have to leave any comments in your code because your code should explain itself
- Break down large problems into smaller, more manageable parts

## What To Do If You Get Ahead

There is plenty of learning you can do if you finish the day‚Äôs activities early:

- Finish any unfinished projects from previous days
- Start or continue work on the [blackjack project](../../blackjack.md)
- CodeWars contains many coding exercises you can use to practice coding. If you want more of a challenge look at LeetCode or harder Katas
- Revise any concepts you feel less confident on
- Work on a personal coding project if you have one
- If you are working on a project, try refactoring your work. Refactoring is where your code does the exact same thing as it did before, but you improve the way it is written (see best coding practices in Day 1 - Getting Started)
- Pair programming (programming with someone else) is a good practice. Pair programming facilitates peer learning and is a firewall against mistakes. It‚Äôs also a great way to spend more time with each other. If you know someone else is ahead as well as you, try pair programming on a coding challenge with them.
- Practice touch typing. Faster typing = faster coding üôÇ¬†(try https://www.edclub.com/sportal/program-3.game if you don‚Äôt know how to touch type)

## Taking Notes

There will be three recurring activities throughout this training period - watching videos, practice exercises and projects

- For the first half of the course (Frontend Masters Complete Intro to Web Development), there will be comprehensive notes available at https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/. Try and code along with him in the interactive sections of these notes as you watch the videos
- Feel free to take notes during the videos or whenever you feel appropriate, but try and avoid pausing the video regularly to take notes as the notes will all be available and you will have plenty of opportunity to practice - it is during the practice that you will learn the concepts properly so don‚Äôt sacrifice practice time for taking notes. That said taking notes is important for having a reference so make sure you take notes in areas that feel like it is needed
- There should be sufficient time to watch the videos on 1x speed and still have time to get the exercises done
- Feel free to copy the notes I have here on Notion

## Final Thoughts

- There will be flashcards at the end of each frontend masters video - write down what you think the answer is and then look at the answer
- Try and avoid copy-pasting wherever you can (unless you‚Äôre copying a link). Writing commands and code out yourself will help you learn
