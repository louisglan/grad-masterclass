# APIs

An API is an Application Programming Interface. It is what you interface with when making a request to a server. You will cover more on this when we look at express

If you want to play around with APIs visit https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis to find free public APIs

CRUD:

- Create - POST
- Read - GET
- Update - PUT/PATCH
- Delete - DELETE

You can make GET, POST, DELETE, etc. requests to HTTP APIs. For example, when you update your Facebook Address, the frontend makes a PUT or a PATCH request to the Facebook API to change that data. Whenever you visit a website you make a GET request for the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that make up that webpage

Most APIs will have some form of documentation to tell you how to interact with them.
