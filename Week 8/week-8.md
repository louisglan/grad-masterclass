# Week 8

This week is the second hackathon week and your final week of training! You will be working solely on making/rewriting a react project all week.

Decide what you want to work on this week. You can choose between:
    - Translate a completed project into React
    - Building a project you didn't finish in React (e.g., if you didn't finish the calculator project, build it from scratch using React)
    - Building any project of your own choice using React that you think you can build within a week. Talk to me first before choosing this option so I can gauge if it is realistic in this time frame

In addition to creating a working product, you can aim to do the following:
- Make the website as accessible as possible
- Test the website as much as you can
- Deploy to Netlify
- Try and find a way to include at least one API request
- If it is appropriate, write your code in OOP style (this will make sense for things like games where you have distinct objects that do things or have things done to them)
- If you're feeling really ambitious, include a database in your project

If you want to learn more about testing then continue watching the [testing videos](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing/). Only spend time on this if you have it. Try and implement the things you learn in your project as you learn them as it is easier to remember them that way

When building the project, aim to first build a minimum viable product (MVP) - the minimum amount to create something that works. Then flesh it out after
