# Tuesday Instructions

Today you will be learning about JSX:

1. Watch the JSX in React lessons, coding along with Brian
2. Create a basic react project for exercises
3. Exercise: In your exercise project:
    - Create three components:
    - One component should be named Hello and it should return 'Hello' wrapped inside of h1.
    - The second component should be named World and it should return 'World!' wrapped inside of h2.
    - Create a parent component called Greet and nest previous two components inside of it, wrapping them with a div.
    - Render the Greet component and check this has worked in your browser
4. In your exercise project, create a function that converts an array to a jsx list component (hint: use the `map` array method). For example, it should convert ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas'] to
    ```
    <ul>
        <li>apples</li>
        <li>oranges</li>
        <li>bananas</li>
    </ul>
    ```
    Render that component and check this has worked in your browser
5. When you finish continue with your projects
