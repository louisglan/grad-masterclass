# Demo/Presentation Guidance

## What to Expect
- You will have a maximum of ten minutes to deliver your demos and receive questions. We don't expect you to use this whole time but if the whole thing is done within five minutes you could probably have said more.
- You will ideally be presenting to a mixture of technical and non-technical people of various ranks, hopefully including at least one partner
- There is no consequence to doing 'well' or 'badly' in this demo - it is merely an opportunity for you to show off what you have learnt and built

## Guidance
- Your audience will contain non-technical people and so if you decide to explain technical concepts to them (which I recommend you attempt), make sure you are doing so as if you are explaining to your grandparents - avoid showing code unless you have to or are really *really* proud of some code and you know there will be someone technical in the audience who will appreciate it
- Try and include:
    - A high level overview of what the app is
    - A walkthrough of all the features you implemented, including less visible features like accessibility
    - If you did anything extra that you wouldn't describe as a feature e.g., automated testing, tell the audience you did this and discuss the benefits of doing so
    - Some level of interactivity
    - A discussion of challenges you faced and how you overcame them. If these are technical challenges, try and simplify them or reframe them in an more understandable way
    - Any interesting quirks etc. you would like to draw attention to
    - What you would do to take it further if you had more time
- If you are concerned about something going wrong in the demo, a common practice is to take a screen recording of the demo and talk over it. Then the only tech you are relying on is the screen recording
- Finally, and most importantly, make sure you do at least one practice run before delivering the presentation - you cannot underestimate how useful this will be. Aim to do at least two, ideally three run throughs
